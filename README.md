`Fashion-MNIST` is a dataset of [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/)'s article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend `Fashion-MNIST` to serve as a direct **drop-in replacement** for the original [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

Here's an example how the data looks (*each class takes three-rows*):

## Why we made Fashion-MNIST

The original [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. *"If it doesn't work on MNIST, it **won't work** at all"*, they said. *"Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others."* 

### To Serious Machine Learning Researchers

Seriously, we are talking about replacing MNIST. Here are some good reasons:

- **MNIST is too easy.** Convolutional nets can achieve 99.7% on MNIST. Classic machine learning algorithms can also achieve 97% easily. Check out [our side-by-side benchmark for Fashion-MNIST vs. MNIST](http://fashion-mnist.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/), and read "[Most pairs of MNIST digits can be distinguished pretty well by just one pixel](https://gist.github.com/dgrtwo/aaef94ecc6a60cd50322c0054cc04478)."
- **MNIST is overused.** In [this April 2017 Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/goodfellow_ian/status/852591106655043584), Google Brain research scientist and deep learning expert Ian Goodfellow calls for people to move away from MNIST.
- **MNIST can not represent modern CV tasks**, as noted in [this April 2017 Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/852594987527045120), deep learning expert/Keras author François Chollet.

## Get the Data

Many ML libraries  already include Fashion-MNIST data/API, give it a try!

You can use direct links to download the dataset. The data is stored in the **same** format as the original [MNIST data](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).


### Labels
Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

| Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | T-shirt/top |
| 1 | Trouser |
| 2 | Pullover |
| 3 | Dress |
| 4 | Coat |
| 5 | Sandal |
| 6 | Shirt |
| 7 | Sneaker |
| 8 | Bag |
| 9 | Ankle boot |

## Usage

### Loading data with Python (requires [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/))

Use `utils/mnist_reader` in this repo:
```python
import mnist_reader
X_train, y_train = mnist_reader.load_mnist('data/fashion', kind='train')
X_test, y_test = mnist_reader.load_mnist('data/fashion', kind='t10k')
```

### Loading data with Tensorflow
Make sure you have [downloaded the data](#get-the-data) and placed it in `data/fashion`. Otherwise, *Tensorflow will download and use the original MNIST.*

```python
from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data
data = input_data.read_data_sets('data/fashion')

data.train.next_batch(BATCH_SIZE)
```

Note, Tensorflow supports passing in a source url to the `read_data_sets`. You may use: 
```python
data = input_data.read_data_sets('data/fashion', source_url='http://fashion-mnist.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/')
```

Also, an official Tensorflow tutorial of using `tf.keras`, a high-level API to train Fashion-MNIST [can be found here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification).
